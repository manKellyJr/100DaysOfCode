| Day | Date | Created | Learned |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------------ | --------- |
| 001 | S 1 Oct 2022 | [Getting Started](001) | I learnt about variables and simple data types. Then I later leant did introduction to Lists. |
| 002 | S 2 Oct 2022 | [Working With Lists](002) | I Learn't about how to work with lists. How to modify list and assign new value to a list index. Differnte methods that can be used on a list |
| 003 | M 3 Oct 2022 | [If Statements](003) | Learn't about if, elif and else statement. And when to use each for different conditions |
| 004 | T 4 Oct 2022 | [Dictionaries](004) | Today I was doing dictionaries. Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. A dictionary can contain lists and any other data type |
| 005 | W 5 Oct 2022 | [User Input and While Loop](005) | I learn't about getting user input and converting the input to the appropriate format when required to. Also storing user input into a dictionary |
| 006 | T 6 Oct 2022 | [Functions](006) | I learn't about functions. Functions allow programs to be broken down into small parts, each of which does one specific job. A function can be called as many times as you possible, and can be stored in separate files.|
| 007 | F 7 Oct 2022 | [Classes](007) | I learn't about classes. classes allows code reuse. Using the same classes to instatiate different objects from it|
| 008 | S 8 Oct 2022 | [Calculator Project](008) | I tried to build a project today. I was learning how to build a calculator. It seems i need to get acquainted to some methods that am not familiar with. The calcualator was successfully built.|
| 009 | S 9 Oct 2022 | [Files and Exceptions](009) | Today I was working with files. Learnt about reading and writing to files|
| 010 | M 10 Oct 2022 | [Files and Exceptions](010) | Continued working on files and exceptions |
| 011 | T 11 Oct 2022 | [Files and Exceptions](011) | Finished learning files and exceptions |
| 012 | W 12 Oct 2022 | [Regular expressions](012) | Learnt about regular expresions and how to use them to find a keyword in a stinrg of texts |
| 013 | T 13 Oct 2022 | [Bagels Game](013) | Today I was building a game called Bagels.  In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number|
| 014 | F 14 Oct 2022 | [Sanek Game](015) | Today I tried to build a snake game but ran into errors. I leant some functions that I was not aware of. I will try again later|
| 015 | S 15 Oct 2022 | [Revisited Functions](015) | I Revisited functions and did some of the examples that I neve did. I really needed to grasp the concept of functions|
| 016 | S 16 Oct 2022 | [Revisited Classes](016) | I am revisiting these topics because I neve fully understood them. But this time I can say that I understand classes|
| 017 | M 17 Oct 2022 | [Revisted Files and Exceptions](017) | Leant how to read a text file. For a file to be used it first needs to be opened|
| 018 | T 18 Oct 2022 |   |  |
| 019 | W 19 Oct 2022 | [Revisted Files and Exceptions 1](019) | Finished working with files. Relent about reading and writing to files |
| 020 | T 20 Oct 2022 | [Python - Test-driven development Python UnitTests TDD](020) | I learnt about writing tests before writing code. And testing the code feels nice when the test is passed. Amazing ! |
| 021 | F 21 Oct 2022 | [Python - Test-driven development Python UnitTests TDD](021) |I finished my Test-Driven Dvelopment ALX project today and I also learnt about unit testing |
